# Law-and-Ethics-in-AI
Welcome to the repository for key concepts in the Law and Ethics in Artificial Intelligence course at the University of Trento for non-attendance students. This repository contains summaries of articles provided for the course. Please note the following:

## Disclaimer
The highlights presented in the LaTeX file are a personal selection. The articles offer a more comprehensive understanding of ethical implications and legal frameworks surrounding AI technology. It's crucial to refer directly to the original articles for Professor Casonato's complete insights and for ensuring academic integrity.

## Accessing the Content
You can download the release or the entire project and compile the LaTeX file on your own system.

## Review and Collaboration
If you wish to rewrite the content in your own words or add information, which I highly suggest you, fork the repository or download it and create an Overleaf project. Instead, if you believe my draft misses key points, contains inaccuracies, needs improvements, or banally contains typos, feel free to open an issue. Collaboration benefits everyone accessing the file.

Please note that the formatting might not be perfect. If you're adept at formatting and can enhance readability, open this issue, I'll grant you editing access to fix it.
